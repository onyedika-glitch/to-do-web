# Laravel Modern AJAX To-Do App

This is a ready-to-run Laravel 10+ project scaffold for a professional **Modern AJAX** To-Do application.

Quick start (after placing inside a Laravel project root):
1. Copy files into your Laravel project (or extract zip into project root).
2. `composer install`
3. Configure `.env` with your DB settings.
4. `php artisan key:generate`
5. `php artisan migrate --seed`
6. `npm install`
7. `npm run build` or `npm run dev`
8. `php artisan serve`

The app uses Tailwind CSS + Vite, and the frontend interacts with the API via `fetch()` (AJAX). Sweet alerts are used for confirmations.
